# GCP-LAB-Vector-Search-and-Embeddings
### Getting Started with Vector Search and Embeddings

## Overview
Vector Search can search from billions of semantically similar or semantically related items. A vector similarity-matching service has many use cases such as implementing recommendation engines, search engines, chatbots, and text classification. Semantic matching can be simplified into a few steps. First, you must generate embedding representations of many items (done outside of Vector Search). Secondly, you upload your embeddings to Google Cloud, and then link your data to Vector Search. After your embeddings are added to Vector Search, you can create an index to run queries to get recommendations or results.

The use of embeddings is not limited to words or text. You can generate semantic embeddings for many kinds of data, including images, audio, video, and user preferences. For generating a multimodal embedding with Vertex AI, see Get multimodal embeddings. In this lab, you will learn how to use Vertex AI Embeddings for text to create text embeddings and use them to create a vector search index.


## Objectives
#### In this lab, you will perform the following tasks:

Create a Vertex AI Notebook Instance
Clone and run the lab notebook
Create text embeddings
Create and deploy vector search index
Query the index


## Task 1. Open the notebook in Vertex AI Workbench
1. In the Google Cloud console, on the Navigation menu (Navigation menu icon), click Vertex AI > Workbench.

2. Find the generative-ai-jupyterlab instance and click on the Open JupyterLab button.
![alt text](images/Task1-2.png)

The JupyterLab interface for your Workbench instance opens in a new browser tab.

3. In the left panel, double-click the intro-textemb-vectorsearch.ipynb notebook file to open it in the right window.

![alt text](images/Task1-3.png)


4. In the Select Kernel dialog, choose Python 3 from the list of available kernels.

5. Scroll down to the Text Embeddings in Action section, and run the setup cells.

#### Install Python SDK
Vertex AI, Cloud Storage and BigQuery APIs can be accessed with multiple ways including REST API and Python SDK. In this tutorial we will use the SDK.

`%pip install --upgrade --user google-cloud-aiplatform google-cloud-storage 'google-cloud-bigquery[pandas]'`

#### Restart current runtime
To use the newly installed packages in this Jupyter runtime, you must restart the runtime. You can do this by running the cell below, which will restart the current kernel.

```#Restart kernel after installs so that your environment can access the new packages
import IPython
app = IPython.Application.instance()
app.kernel.do_shutdown(True)
```

#### Environment variables
Sets environment variables. If asked, please replace the following [your-project-id] with your project ID and run it.


```# get project ID
PROJECT_ID = ! gcloud config get project
PROJECT_ID = PROJECT_ID[0]
LOCATION = "us-west1"
if PROJECT_ID == "(unset)":
    print(f"Please set the project ID manually below")
```


```# define project information
if PROJECT_ID == "(unset)":
    PROJECT_ID = "[your-project-id]"  # @param {type:"string"}

# generate an unique id for this session
from datetime import datetime

UID = datetime.now().strftime("%m%d%H%M")
```

#### Enable APIs
Run the following to enable APIs for Compute Engine, Vertex AI, Cloud Storage and BigQuery with this Google Cloud project.

```! gcloud services enable compute.googleapis.com aiplatform.googleapis.com storage.googleapis.com bigquery.googleapis.com --project {PROJECT_ID}```

#### Set IAM permissionsÂ¶
Also, we need to add access permissions to the default service account for using those services.

Go to the IAM page in the Console
Look for the principal for default compute service account. It should look like: <project-number>-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com
Click the edit button at right and click ADD ANOTHER ROLE to add Vertex AI User, BigQuery User and Storage Admin to the account.


6. When setting your environment variables, use Region for the location, and Project ID for the Project ID.

![alt text](images/Task1-6.png)

> Note: you can skip any notebook cells that are noted Colab only.

7. Skip the Set IAM permissions section, as your service account already has the required permissions.



## Task 2. Generate embeddings
Navigate to the Getting Started with Vertex AI Embeddings for Text section and run through the cells to create the text embeddings.

Navigate to the Getting Started with Vector Search section and run through the cells.

Data Preparation
We will be using the Stack Overflow public dataset hosted on BigQuery table bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions. This is a very big dataset with 23 million rows that doesn't fit into the memory. We are going to limit it to 1000 rows for this tutorial.

```
# load the BQ Table into a Pandas DataFrame
from google.cloud import bigquery

QUESTIONS_SIZE = 1000

bq_client = bigquery.Client(project=PROJECT_ID)
QUERY_TEMPLATE = """
        SELECT distinct q.id, q.title
        FROM (SELECT * FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
        where Score > 0 ORDER BY View_Count desc) AS q
        LIMIT {limit} ;
        """
query = QUERY_TEMPLATE.format(limit=QUESTIONS_SIZE)
query_job = bq_client.query(query)
rows = query_job.result()
df = rows.to_dataframe()

# examine the data
df.head()```

Call the API to generate embeddings
With the Stack Overflow dataset, we will use the title column (the question title) and generate embedding for it with Embeddings for Text API. The API is available under the vertexai package of the SDK.

You may see some warning messages from the TensorFlow library but you can ignore them.

```
# init the vertexai package
import vertexai

vertexai.init(project=PROJECT_ID, location=LOCATION)
```
From the package, import TextEmbeddingModel and get a model.
```
# Load the text embeddings model
from vertexai.language_models import TextEmbeddingModel

model = TextEmbeddingModel.from_pretrained("text-embedding-004")
```

```
import time

import tqdm  # to show a progress bar

# get embeddings for a list of texts
BATCH_SIZE = 5


def get_embeddings_wrapper(texts):
    embs = []
    for i in tqdm.tqdm(range(0, len(texts), BATCH_SIZE)):
        time.sleep(1)  # to avoid the quota error
        result = model.get_embeddings(texts[i : i + BATCH_SIZE])
        embs = embs + [e.values for e in result]
    return embs
```
The following code will get embedding for the question titles and add them as a new column embedding to the DataFrame. This will take a few minutes.

```
# get embeddings for the question titles and add them as "embedding" column
df = df.assign(embedding=get_embeddings_wrapper(list(df.title)))
df.head()
```

In the following code, it picks up one question randomly and uses the numpy np.dot function to calculate the similarities between the question and other questions.

```import random

import numpy as np

# pick one of them as a key question
key = random.randint(0, len(df))

# calc dot product between the key and other questions
embs = np.array(df.embedding.to_list())
similarities = np.dot(embs[key], embs.T)

# print similarities for the first 5 questions
similarities[:5]
```

>array([0.27901936, 0.2547825 , 0.29988203, 0.33097578, 0.23214255])


Finally, sort the questions with the similarities and print the list.

```
# print the question
print(f"Key question: {df.title[key]}\n")

# sort and print the questions by similarities
sorted_questions = sorted(
    zip(df.title, similarities), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True
)[:20]
for i, (question, similarity) in enumerate(sorted_questions):
    print(f"{similarity:.4f} {question}")
```

Save the embeddings in a JSON file.

First, export the id and embedding columns from the DataFrame in JSONL format, and save it.

```# save id and embedding as a json file
jsonl_string = df[["id", "embedding"]].to_json(orient="records", lines=True)
with open("questions.json", "w") as f:
    f.write(jsonl_string)

# show the first few lines of the json file
! head -n 3 questions.json```



Create a new Cloud Storage bucket and copy the file to it.

gs://qwiklabs-gcp-03-0a1b8e8349dc-embvs-tutorial-05040419



```BUCKET_URI = f"gs://{PROJECT_ID}-embvs-tutorial-{UID}"
! gsutil mb -l $LOCATION -p {PROJECT_ID} {BUCKET_URI}
! gsutil cp questions.json {BUCKET_URI}```

## Task 3. Create and deploy an index
Navigate to the Create an Index section and run through the cells to create and deploy an index.

> Note: index creation and deployment takes around 20-30 minutes. Feel free to check out the following resources while you wait.


```
# init the aiplatform package
from google.cloud import aiplatform

aiplatform.init(project=PROJECT_ID, location=LOCATION)
```

>Create an MatchingEngineIndex with its create_tree_ah_index function (Matching Engine is the previous name of Vector Search).


```# create index
my_index = aiplatform.MatchingEngineIndex.create_tree_ah_index(
    display_name=f"embvs-tutorial-index-{UID}",
    contents_delta_uri=BUCKET_URI,
    dimensions=768,
    approximate_neighbors_count=20,
    distance_measure_type="DOT_PRODUCT_DISTANCE",
)
```

Explore Vector Search and try the demo
In this task, you will explore the Vector search notebook and try the public demo. Since index creation and deployment takes ~30 minutes, you can try the public demo and explore the notebook while you wait.

While you wait: Try the Stack Overflow semantic search demo
The Vector Search public demo is available as a public live demo. Select "STACKOVERFLOW" and enter any coding question as a query, so it runs a text search on 8 million questions posted on Stack Overflow. Try the text semantic search with some queries like 'How to shuffle rows in SQL?' or arbitrary programming questions.
While you wait: Explore the Vector Search notebook
In the notebook, navigate to the Bringing Gen AI and LLMs to production services section at the top and read through the vector search use cases and explanations.
